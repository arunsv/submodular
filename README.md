This repo provides for a collection of routines for using submodular optimization for system design.Applications considered are sensor placement and leader selection.


The various submodular optimization flows considered are:
a. Ordinary greedy

b. Greedy with lazy evaluations

c. Stochastic greedy

d. Multi-stage greedy
